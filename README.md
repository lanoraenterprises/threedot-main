# Threedots Film Studio Website

This is the official homepage for Threedots Film Studio, built with Vite, Vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `src/style.css`: All the styling (Dark mode, animations, responsive design).
- `src/main.js`: Interaction logic (Scroll animations).
- `public/`: Static assets (images, icons).

## How to Run Locally

2.  Install dependencies (if new):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:

## How to Build for Production and Share

To create a final version of the site that can be uploaded to the web:

1.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  This will create a `dist` folder.
3.  You can upload the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
