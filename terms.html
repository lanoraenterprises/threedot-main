                    <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
                    <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on

                        website (https://threedotsfilmstudio.com) and registering for our event, you agree that you have
                        read,
                        understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

                    <h3>2. Event Registration</h3>
                    <p>All registrations are subject to approval. We reserve the right to reject any registration at our
                        discretion.</p>

                    <h3>3. Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
                    <p>All ticket sales are final. No refunds or exchanges will be issued unless the event is cancelled
                        by the organizers. In the event of a cancellation, our liability is limited to the face value of
                        the ticket.</p>

                    <h3>4. Code of Conduct</h3>

                        harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be
                        sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

                        source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text,

                    <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>In no event will we or our directors, employees, or agents be liable to you or any third party
                        for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages
